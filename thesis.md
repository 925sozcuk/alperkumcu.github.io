I'm transferring my PhD thesis (written in .docx) into a R Markdown document using ```markdown``` and ```bookdown``` packages in R. The output will be presented on this page as an interactive .html file.

This is a work in progress. Please visit <a href = "https://alperkumcu.github.io/docs/thesis/index.html">Thesis</a>.
