I was born in 1986 and I have been working as a researcher for the last 10 years as of 2018. My academic background looks like I chose a dual classing (a mage and a fighter maybe? - you say which one is which) in a FRP, the truth is I've discovered that I just happen to enjoy interdisciplinary research and am lucky enough to stick with what I enjoy in life.
