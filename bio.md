I was born in 1986 and I have been working as a researcher for the last 10 years as of 2018. Much as my academic background looks like I chose dual classing (a mage and a fighter maybe? - you say which one is which) in a RPG, the truth is I have discovered that I just happen to enjoy interdisciplinary research. I think I am lucky enough to stick with what I enjoy in life. Other than that; I teach, write, take photos and enjoy dreaming about aliens (in this particular order). And I'm terribly allergic to bad grammar.
